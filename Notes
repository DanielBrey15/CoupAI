Reinforcement learning for calling out should be very easy, 
but I can't do it until people are lying, which means I need to determine optimal
move first.

I should refactor so they decide best action, not best move (which means it'll include target)

Then I need a ML model to determine best move, a ML model to determine call outs, and a third
one to determine blocks (also can use instant reward/punishment bc of call out)
